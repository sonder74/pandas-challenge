## Project Goals
With this project, I was able to take my deepest dive yet into the Python programming language. The project's tasks focus on banking and election data, and they are designed to give students a solid foundation in a code that will serve as the basis for many projects (and perhaps job opportunities) to come. 

## Tools and Solutions
With my **Heroes of Pymoli** project, I had my first opportunity to use what have since become two of my favorite data-analyis tools: Jupyter Notebooks and Python's Pandas library. I used them to access a large set of fantasy-game purchasing data and to create <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/pandas-challenge/blob/master/**HeroesOfPymoli**/HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb">a long series of Pandas dataframes</a>. Together, these dataframes and the Python logic that I wrote helped me to visualize sales trends, customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and more.

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned
As a result of my data analysis and visualization, I was able to observe <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/pandas-challenge/blob/master/**HeroesOfPymoli**/HeroesOfPymoliTrends.txt">three distinct trends</a>:

* Most of the players of Heroes of Pymoli are male, and they are more likely to be between the ages of 20 and 24 than any other age.

* Female players of Heroes of Pymoli account for fewer item purchases than male players, but they tend to buy more expensive items.

* The makers of Heroes of Pymoli may have an opportunity to increase profits by raising the prices of 'Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy' and 'Extraction, Quickblade Of Trembling Hands.' They are the lowest-priced of the game's five most popular items, and neither is currently among the game's five most profitable items.

**Pandas-challenge** was definitely my favorite homework assignment to date. Pandas dataframes are clear and simple way to visualize complex data, and the Python that powers them is genuinely fun to write. I look forward to using these tools later in this class.
